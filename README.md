# embedded-systems
Code written in C for Udemy embedded systems courses, using the STM32 Nucleo board. 
Taking courses offered [here.](https://www.udemy.com/user/kiran-nayak-2/) 
I have finished the following courses:
- MCU1 (24.5h) - covered header files, wired communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART/USART), GPIOs & general behaviour of the STM MCU
- ARM Cortex-M3/M4 Processor (15h) - covered processor-specific protocols (eg. function calls), inline assembly and naked functions, bare metal embedded C

Working on:
- MCU2
- RTOS
